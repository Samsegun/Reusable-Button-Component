Hey there, i took this challenge from <a href="https://devchallenges.io/">devchallenges </a>. You can find a demo of my solution <a href="https://samsegun-button-component.netlify.app/">

This challenge made me realise how versatile and consistent web components can be in front end projects. It also made me improve on building reusable, dynamic components and how to apply various styling to each instance of a component.
